# CalendarView - MVVM Architecture

This project implements a calendar view for a hotel booking system using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern in SwiftUI.

## Architecture Overview

### Model
- `Guest`: Represents a guest staying at the hotel, including their name, room, stay dates, and room type.

### ViewModel
- `CalendarViewModel`: Contains all the business logic and state management for the calendar view.
- `CalendarViewUIHelpers`: Extension to the ViewModel that provides UI-specific helper methods and configurations.

### View
- `CalendarView`: The main view that renders the calendar UI based on the ViewModel's state.

## Key Features

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - The View is responsible only for rendering the UI
   - The ViewModel handles all business logic and state management
   - The Model represents the data structure

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Adapts to both portrait and landscape orientations
   - Optimizes layout based on available screen space

3. **Interactive Elements**
   - Week picker dropdown
   - Collapsible room sections
   - Navigation between weeks

4. **Reusable Components**
   - Button styles are applied consistently throughout the app
   - UI configurations are generated by the ViewModel

## Benefits of MVVM in this Project

1. **Maintainability**: Changes to the business logic can be made in the ViewModel without affecting the View.
2. **Testability**: The ViewModel can be tested independently of the UI.
3. **Reusability**: UI components and logic can be reused across different views.
4. **Scalability**: New features can be added more easily by extending the ViewModel.

## Implementation Details

### UI Helper Methods

The `CalendarViewUIHelpers` extension provides methods that generate UI configurations:

- `handleTodayButtonTap()`: Handles the Today button action
- `getWeekPickerOptions()`: Returns configuration for week picker dropdown options
- `getOccupancyRowConfiguration()`: Returns configuration for occupancy rows

These methods allow the View to focus on rendering rather than calculating layouts or managing state.

### View Components

The `CalendarView` extension contains UI component methods:

- `todayButton()`: Renders the Today button
- `weekPickerView()`: Renders the week picker dropdown
- `navigationButtonsView()`: Renders the navigation buttons
- `occupancyRow()`: Renders an occupancy row for a room
- `headerView()`: Renders the app header

These components use the configurations provided by the ViewModel to render the UI.
